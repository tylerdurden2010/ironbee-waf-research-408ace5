These tests are designed to establish a baseline by determining what
parts of a request are being inspected.

To run the tests:

 1. Configure the WAF to block the pattern "UNION SELECT", using any
    status code other than 200

 2. Run the baseline test and check that it returns OK

   ../run-test.pl 192.168.3.100:8080 b00-01-normal.test

 3. Run all tests and record results:

   ../run-test.pl 192.168.3.100:8080 *.test

 4. When a test reports MISSED, that means that the device did not detect
    the attack payload.
