These tests are designed to test multipart/form-data parsers for sensitivity
to partially malformed requests. The tests purposefully do not contain any attack
patterns. The idea is to only test one aspect of processing at a time. If we
determine a weakness in a particular implementation, we can attempt to craft an
exploit for it.

The test mXX-modsecurity-evasion.test contains an example of one such
exploit.

To run the tests:

 1. Configure the WAF to:

   1.1. Be extra sensitive to malformed traffic
   1.2. Block with any response other than 200

 2. Run the baseline test and check that it returns OK

   ../run-test.pl 192.168.3.100:8080 m00-01-normal.test

 3. Run all tests and record results:

   ../run-test.pl 192.168.3.100:8080 *.test

 4. Examine WAF warnings and error messages

   4.1. Ensure that no requests were blocked for any issue other than
        malformed multipart/form-data traffic
   4.2. Repeat tests as necessary
   4.3. Record the final set of warnings and errors, as they may
        be helpful in determining whether a weakness is a genuine
        weakness and whether it can be exploited. Use an export feature
        where available, screenshots of admin interfaces as last
        resort.
